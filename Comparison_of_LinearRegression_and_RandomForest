Algorithms Used  
• Linear Regression: A simple regression algorithm that fits a linear equation to model 
the relationship between the target and features.  
• Random Forest Regressor: a technique for ensemble learning that reduces overfitting 
and increases prediction accuracy by combining the predictions of several decision 
trees.

In conclusion, the Environmental Pollution Prediction problem is a supervised 
learning and a regression problem. After the implementation of Random Forest and 
Linear Regression algorithms, it was observed that linear regression is a more logical 
solution to this problem. Linear regression has lower errors and higher scores, requires 
low storage, and works fast. Linear Regression is the better solution for this problem.
